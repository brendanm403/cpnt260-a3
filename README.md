## Important Notes
- context: I have placed myself in the world of pokemon in the region called "Hoenn". The hero section depicts something like you may see on a national park website or tourist attraction. The main goal of the hero section is to get people to sign up for a tour of the desert located in Hoenn.

- I asked you if it was okay to use pixels for some ranges in the media queries and you said it was fine. I used two media queries with pixels to fine tune some mobile displays.

- When inspecting the text for contrast ratio you'll notice firefox will tell you that its calculating the value against a white background if you inspect the h2. Instead, if you inspect the anchor element inside the h2, uncheck the `color: inherit` property, and then inspect the color in the .card-title-day/.card-title-night classes it will show you the contrast value calculated against the correct background color.

-I added a smidge of js, all it does is change the little image in each card.
